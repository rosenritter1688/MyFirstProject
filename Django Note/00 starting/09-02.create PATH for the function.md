##Django並沒有義務去找這個檔案，他只會找urls.py

##django has no obligation to look at this file, django will only look at the urls.py which in in the prokect folder "MyFirstProject"
##C:\Users\Bruce Ashbee\Documents\MyFirstProject\MyFirstProject\urls.py
##
#! #http://127.0.0.1:8000/food/hello




### django 會找URL設定"root_urlconfig"，是位於setting.py
### 圖片例子是告知django在folder mysite.urls
### 他就會去資料夾找urls.py檔案
### 對照這個檔案和incoming request from the website
### call the view 

#### Django actually looks for the incoming request and when it receives an incoming request first of all it looks for something which is called as the root_urlconf which is located in setting.py file.
#### 先找ROOT在哪，圖片告知要去MyFirstProject資料夾去找urls.py
#### So it is going to compare the request which was sent by the user to the URL #### patterns which are present
